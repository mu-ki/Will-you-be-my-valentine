# Valentine's Force Invite ❤️

A playful, interactive "Valentine's Trap" web app where saying "No" is simply not an option. Designed to be cheeky, persistent, and ultimately successful.

## 🔗 Live Demo
**[Check it out here!](https://jabbourdan.github.io/valantine_force_invite/)**

## ✨ Features
* **Multilingual Support:** Fully translated into **English**, **Hebrew**, and **Arabic**.
* **RTL Support:** Native Right-to-Left layout for Hebrew and Arabic speakers.
* **Persistent Logic:** The "No" button triggers increasingly desperate pleas, while the "Yes" button grows until it dominates the screen.
* **Visual Polish:** Features smooth CSS animations, a pulsing "Yes" button, and a celebratory heart explosion upon success.

## 🚀 How it Works
1.  The user is asked to be your Valentine.
2.  If they click "No", the button text changes and the "Yes" button grows larger.
3.  Once they (inevitably) click "Yes", the buttons disappear, the banner changes, and hearts fill the screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Custom animations & gradients)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (No heavy libraries needed)
